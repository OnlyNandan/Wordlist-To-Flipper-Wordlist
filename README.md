# WordList Converter

This Python script converts a wordlist file into a format suitable for use with keyboard automation tools like AutoHotkey. It adds "STRING" before each word in the wordlist and appends "ENTER" after each word. Optionally, it can also add a delay between each entry.

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. **Ensure you have Python installed** on your system.
3. **Run the script** `converter.py`.
4. **Save the input wordlist** in the same directory as the repository.
5. **Follow the prompts** to enter the filenames for the wordlist and output file, specify if you want to add a delay, and if so, the delay time.
6. The converted wordlist will be saved in the specified output file.
